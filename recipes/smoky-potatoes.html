    <h2>A light and flavoursome snack</h2>

    <p>New Potatoes cooked with a smoky flavour, you can keep them whole or cut in half. Perfect for a summer afternoon on the barbeque.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>800g new potatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>25g butter</li>
        <li>1 small garlic clove crushed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Tip the potatoes into a large pan of salted water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 5-8 mins until just cooked through,
        then drain. Return to the pan.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are still steaming, toss in the paprika, butter, crushed garlic and a large pinch of salt, then
        serve. Or, for added smokiness, tip the potatoes onto a large piece of foil or into a flameproof pan. Scrunch the foil
        to create a parcel that’s open at the top, then sit it on the side of the barbecue in indirect heat so the potatoes
        sizzle in the butter. If the barbecue has a lid, close it and cook the potatoes for 15-20 mins until starting to turn
        golden (this adds smoky flavour – don’t worry, the potatoes will not overcook), then serve from the parcel or pan.</li>
    </ol>
